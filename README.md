# Data Science at Scale Specialization
Specialisation course from **University of Washington** provided by Coursera

To follow the honor code agreement, I will musk my assignment code. 

Purpose for this course is to gain hands-on experience with scalable SQL and NoSQL data management solutions, data mining algorithms, and practical statistical and machine learning concepts. 
Learn how to visuliza data and communicate results. 

1. Data Manipulation at Scale: Systems and Algorithms

   ⋅⋅1. Use the programming models associated with scalable data manipulation, including relational algebra, mapreduce, and other data flow models. 
   ⋅⋅2. Use database technology adapted for large-scale analytics, including the concepts driving parallel databases, parallel query processing, and in-database analytics
   ⋅⋅3. “Think” in MapReduce to effectively write algorithms for systems including Hadoop and Spark.  You will understand their limitations, design details, their relationship to databases, and their associated ecosystem of algorithms, extensions, and languages. write programs in Spark
   ⋅⋅4.Courseworks and Assignment 
   ⋅⋅⋅
2. Practical Predictive Analytics: Models and Methods
    ⋅⋅1. Design effective experiments and analyze the results 
    ⋅⋅2. Use resampling methods to make clear and bulletproof statistical arguments without invoking esoteric notation 
    ⋅⋅3. Explain and apply a core set of classification methods of increasing complexity (rules, trees, random forests), and associated optimization methods (gradient descent and variants) 
    ⋅⋅4. Explain and apply a set of unsupervised learning concepts and methods 
    ⋅⋅5. Describe the common idioms of large-scale graph analytics, including structural query, traversals and recursive queries, PageRank, and community detection

3. Communicating Data Science Results
    ⋅⋅1. 
4. Data Science at Scale - Capstone Project
